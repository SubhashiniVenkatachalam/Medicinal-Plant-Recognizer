# 🌿 Medicinal Plant Recognizer – AI-Based Image Classification Project

This project was developed as part of an AI/ML course and aims to identify medicinal plants from images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging a custom ResNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model achieves high accuracy while significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual plant identification.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Problem Addressed**: Manual identification of medicinal plants is time-consuming and error-prone, leading to misclassification and economic losses.
- 🧠 **Solution**: A ResNet-based CNN trained on a curated dataset of 1,550 images across 34 medicinal plant species.
- 📈 **Accuracy**: Achieved over 98% accuracy in classification.
- ⏱️ **Efficiency**: Reduced average identification time by 90% (from 3 hours to under 20 minutes).
- 🌐 **Use Cases**: Targeted for healthcare practitioners, Ayurvedic researchers, farmers, and the herbal medicine industry.
